### 2026-01-06 - PROPOSAL.md+Branches, Updated plan
PROPOSAL.md was updated with the proposal my partner and I created (5 minutes), we joined the repo and created our branches (3 minutes). AT HOME: Updated main.c with a more detailed and thought out plan of how to achieve this, created p1.c and p2.c files with preliminary player1Logic() and player2Logic() functions and added them into main.h, updated makefile (1 hour).

### 2026-01-07 - Extra planning+starting logic functions, created templates of functions+worked more on logic functions
My partner and I spent most of our class time (~25 minutes) planning how to make this game work and rethinking our past ideas (like deciding to use an array for the board instead of a .txt file), an initial version of player1Logic() was created outlining where it would connect with player 2 and printing out initial messages to the player, saying what their token is and reading from stdin to ask for the move they want to make. AT HOME: main.c and main.h were updated with 3 new function templates: checkBoard, printBoard, and updateBoard, with comments on what they're supposed to do and what they return, the player1Logic() and player2Logic() functions were written to incorporate the new board functions and have full outlines for how a single Connect 4 game would be completed (but not a tournament yet), the only thing missing from the logic functions is actual communication between the 2 players (with comments showing where those need to be implemented), also updated makefile and main to fix a small issue (1.5 hours).

### 2026-01-08 - Reworked plan+added networking files, editing networking files
We asked Mr. K for advice during class and he told us to rework our plan and explained how we should go about it (~40 minutes), added files from networking lab for future use (5 minutes). AT HOME: Edited networking files with comments to reflect new plan (~20 minutes).

### 2026-01-09 - Editing networking files
