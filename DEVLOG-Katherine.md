Setting up files and outlining plan.

### 2026-01-08 | ~1:20 AM
Discussed project in class. Trying to figure out how to start and whether to use sockets/semaphores and struct vs file to store the data.
Tried to work on semaphore logic at home.


### 2026-01-08 | ~1:30 AM
Figured out that we need a server, two clients, and sockets in class. Started working on switching from semaphores to sockets based on prior networking lab. Created player.c to try and merge player c files. Mostly testing connections to server and clients.
